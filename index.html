   <p>Leo was born in the Bronx in 1921. His father, Domenico, immigrated to America from Italy in 1913, and after a separation of six years due to the outbreak of WWI, was followed by Angela in 1919.</p>
   <p>He attended high school in the Bronx and served in the Army during WW II in France, cherishing the friendships he made there throughout his life.</p>

   <p>Leo and Pat were married in 1950, and raised their children in the Bronx, with Leo working as a tool and die maker in NYC and Mount Vernon.</p>
   <p>In 1987 they moved to Pleasantville for the last 24 years of their lives together. Leo was predeceased by four siblings (Lou, Gina, Johnny, and Joe).</p>

   <p>Domenico Del Savio and Angela Zampol were from the neighboring towns of Caneva and Stevenà. They were married in Caneva’s Church of San Tommaso in 1907.</p>
   <p>Domenico came to the United States in 1913, leaving behind his pregnant wife Angela and their three young children. He lived with family members and friends from Italy at 610 191st Street near Arthur Avenue in The Bronx.</p>

   <p>His family planned to join him shortly after he found work and was able to save some money to send for them. But, with the outbreak of World War I in Europe, it became impossible for Angela and the children to travel to the United States.</p>
   <p>In America, Domenico worked as a carpenter, a trade he learned from his father, specializing in decorative woodwork in museums, libraries and mansions in the New York City area. Domenico’s work can still be seen at The Bronx Botanical Gardens and St. Lucy’s in The Bronx, New York.</p>
   <p>In 1919, after the war was over, Angela departed for the United States with her four children. Regina, whose American name became “Gina,” was 11 years old. Luigi “Louie” was 9, Giovanni “Johnny” was 7 and Giuseppe “Joe” was 6 years old. Domenico and Angela’s youngest son, Leo, was born in New York on October 8, 1921, after the family was finally reunited.</p>
   <p>When the children came to America they only spoke Italian. They all studied English at school and eventually taught Leo English too. Domenico and Angela learned some English but always spoke Italian at home and in their predominantly Italian neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Domenico and Angela raised their family in The Bronx, moving a handful of times as they raised their children. Leo attended Evander High School in the Bronx.</p>
   <p>Leo said that his father was always doodling designs to carve and could often be found whittling a small piece of wood. Domenico enjoyed playing the accordion, a hobby he carried with him from Italy. Angela was the Del Savio family correspondent, writing to relatives back in Italy.</p>

   <p>Domenico passed away in 1960. Angela passed in 1979.</p>
   <p>Leo met Patricia Brennan, or Patsy, at a dance after returning home from serving in the Army during WWII. Leo was going to ask Patsy’s sister Ellie to dance, but Mike swooped in and got to Ellie first. Leo danced with Patsy instead.</p>
   <p>Within a few years, Leo and Patsy were married, and Ellie and Mike were married.</p>
